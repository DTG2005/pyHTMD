# pyHTMD

This is a CLI tool that works to convert HTML text into MD text and vice versa using the easy way out (Oh boy, yes. Unfortunately, yes, I did this.). It is only in its early stages now and as such, feel free to contribute and suggest changes to it.

## Getting Started/Installation

Installation is as easy as cloning the repository and (if you want the tool to work in any directory) adding the same to PATH environment variables

### Cloning

1. To clone, we use CLI

```ps
git clone https://github.com/DTG2005/pyHTMD
```

2. Next up, we run the command with any file that you wish to convert into the other version, HTML or MD.

```ps
python3 main.py [path/to/the/file(or folder)]
```

3. Enjoy your MD/HTML converted file.

## Dependencies
