# pyHTMD

This is a CLI tool that works to convert HTML text into MD text and vice versa through heavy string manipulation. It is only in its early stages now and as such, feel free to contribute and suggest changes to it.

## Getting Started/Installation

Installation is as easy as cloning the repository and (if you want the tool to work in any directory) adding the same to PATH environment variables

### Cloning

1. To clone, we use CLI

```ps
git clone https://github.com/DTG2005/pyHTMD
```

2. Next up, we run the command with any file that you wish to convert into the other version, HTML or MD.

```ps
python3 main.py [path/to/the/file]
```

3. Enjoy your MD/HTML converted file.

## Dependencies

No dependencies as such are required except for the fact that the file organisation needs to be maintained.
